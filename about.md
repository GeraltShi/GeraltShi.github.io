I am a 1st-year Ph.D. candidate at [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu){:target="_blank"} advised by [Prof. John Owens](https://ece.ucdavis.edu/~jowens/research.html){:target="_blank"}. I received a B.Eng. in Microelectronics from [Fudan University](http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/){:target="_blank"}, where I was advised by [Prof. Patrick Chiang](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/people/chiang-patrick){:target="_blank"}.

# Undergraduate Projects

*I prefer to use names in myths for repos.*

- [ToF Gesture Capturing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJqxU2ieFg){:target="_blank"} - An FPGA based gesture capturing system with ToF components.
- [Zeus](https://github.com/GeraltShi/Zeus){:target="_blank"} - A hardware implementation from [NVDLA](http://nvdla.org/){:target="_blank"}'s RTL code (small config) to ZYNQ platforms.
A block design of ZYNQ platforms and a wrapper for NVDLA and AXI_to_APB bridge are implemented.
- [ZCU104-ChaiDNN](https://github.com/GeraltShi/ZCU104-ChaiDNN){:target="_blank"} - An out-of-the-box implementation of CHaiDNN on Xilinx ZCU104. Sanity run of GoogleNet is passed.
- [Gaia](https://github.com/GeraltShi/Gaia){:target="_blank"} - I have done ASIC verifications with UVM methodology before. This is a template to generate UVM testbench files with Python 3.
- [Iapetos](https://github.com/GeraltShi/Iapetos){:target="_blank"} - An Imitation of the game [the Binding of Isaac](https://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/The_Binding_of_Isaac/){:target="_blank"} with [cocos2d-x](https://cocos2d-x.org/){:target="_blank"}. *This project is out of technical interest and only used for non-commercial purposes.*
- [FusionAccel (Undergraduate thesis)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02217){:target="_blank"} - An RTL-level convolutional network accelerator implementation on Xilinx Spartan-6.
- [Enceladus](https://github.com/GeraltShi/Enceladus){:target="_blank"} - Get Netease music lyrics + timestamps with Python 3.

# Some Interesting Websites and Software

- [Cmder(ConEMU)](http://cmder.net/){:target="_blank"} The best third-party console emulator for windows from my observation.
- [Figlet](http://www.figlet.org/){:target="_blank"} Make your console output cool! And there is a python implementation called [pyfiglet](https://pypi.org/project/pyfiglet/){:target="_blank"}.
- [MIDI CITY](http://midicity-2000.glitch.me/){:target="_blank"} Old-school Art.
- [waifu2x](http://waifu2x.udp.jp/){:target="_blank"} Use CNN to improve image quality.
- [CodeZen](http://codezen.rishimohan.me/){:target="_blank"} Generate beautiful images of your source code.
- [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/){:target="_blank"} Another code image generator that supports more languages.
